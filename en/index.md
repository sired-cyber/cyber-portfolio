# Hi â€” I'm Edgar AKA sirEd
Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. I have created this portfolio with the intention to teach to others what I am learning about the vast world of cybersecurity, new topics that can be of interest, Capture The Flags (CTFs) write ups, and any projects that came to my mind. Furthermore, my intention is to publish everything in both, English and Spanish, in order to contribute a little more to the cyber community
Below are quick links to the English sections.
