# Hi â€” I'm Edgar AKA sirEd
Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. I have created this portfolio with the intention to teach others what I am learning about the vast world of cybersecurity, new topics that can be of interest, Capture The Flags (CTFs) write ups, and any projects that come to my mind. Furthermore, my intention is to publish everything in both languages, English and Spanish, in order to contribute a little more to the cyber community.

Below are quick links to the English sections.
